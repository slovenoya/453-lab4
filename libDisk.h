nBytes should be a number that is evenly divisible 
by the block size. 
If nBytes > 0 and there is already a file by 
the given filename, that disk is resized to nBytes, 
and that fileâ€™s contents may be overwritten. 
If nBytes is 0, an existing disk is opened, 
and should not be overwritten. 
There is no requirement to maintain integrity 
of any content beyond nBytes. Errors must be 
returned for any other failures, as defined by 
your own error code system.  */
